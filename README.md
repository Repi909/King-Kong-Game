King-Kong-Game 

This was a university project given with 4 weeks deadline for Part-time students.

The task was to create a windows console game using the requisite libraries for which I created a game using OOP.

The idea of the game is to have a plane dodging bananas being thrown by King Kong on the right hand of the console.
