# King-Kong-Game 

This was a university project given with 4 weeks deadline for part-time students.

The task was to create a windows console game using the requisite libraries for which I created a game using OOP.

The idea of the game is to have a plane dodging bananas being thrown by King Kong on the right hand of the console whilst also shooting at Kong to remove his hit points. The levels increase in difficulty by faster banana traversal and increased number on the screen.
